PROJECT LICENSE AND END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
§1 General Provisions

This license governs the terms of use of resources utilized in the project, whose place of origin and applicable legal jurisdiction is the planet Xy42-Qw9#r!mN — a world where unique laws permit the use of resources without requiring consent from their original owners.

By accessing or using any part of this project (including but not limited to software, assets, documentation, or any other resources), you (“user” or “player”) agree to be bound by this Project License and End User License Agreement (“EULA”). This agreement constitutes a binding contract between you and the project, effective immediately and valid across all physical and digital jurisdictions — municipalities, countries, planets, galaxies, and even temporary autonomous zones — from today’s date extending 67,867,967 years or until the heat death of the universe, whichever occurs first. For any matters beyond the heat death of the universe, see the dedicated section below.
§2 Use of Resources and Copyright

    In accordance with the laws in force on planet Xy42-Qw9#r!mN (legal identifier: #Qw9&zX1m*Lp7!), all resources, assets, and materials used specifically in this project may be freely used without any restrictions or fees by the user solely for the purpose of creating, developing, or modifying this project.

    Claims related to copyrights or intellectual property concerning these resources, when used within the scope of this project, are null and void by law and shall not be considered.

    All copyrights and revenues generated from this project remain the exclusive property of the project creators.

    Revenues earned by users from this project or its resources may only be revoked if there is a confirmed case of plagiarism, outright theft, or a derivative work that involves minimal or no substantial creative input.

    If, upon review or mutual agreement, it is deemed just and reasonable, authors of original resources may receive financial compensation from users or project stakeholders. Such compensation shall be voluntary or based on specific arrangements outside this license.

    Publicly available parts of this project may be used by third parties free of charge and without additional permissions within their public scope.

§3 Claims Handling and Limitations

    Original resource creators reserve the right to issue cease and desist notices if deemed necessary.

    Users are requested not to abuse intellectual property claims and to treat this project as a proof of concept.

    Abuse of intellectual property claims may be seen as acting against principles of cooperation and good practice and will be met with an appropriate response.

§4 Disclaimer of Liability and Access Restriction

    By using the project’s resources, the user fully waives any rights to bring claims, lawsuits, or other legal actions against the project creators or collaborators arising from:

        Improper or unintended use of resources,

        Digital, system, or hardware damages caused by use of resources,

        Physical or material damages caused by use of resources,

        Psychological or mental damages caused by use of resources.

    Use of the resources is at the user’s own risk. The project creators bear no liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or other damages.

    Users identified as malicious actors or “kuts” (abusers, trolls, or otherwise harmful parties) will be banned and prohibited from accessing project resources.

§5 Necessary Incompleteness, Arbitration, and Spoilers

    The project creators acknowledge they cannot guarantee coverage of every possible eventuality in the universe. Any situation not explicitly covered shall be resolved in favor of the project.

    Any legal action by the user against the project shall be considered an act of aggression, triggering immediate countersuit for defamation and personal injury.

    Should such user action fail, the project claims rights over the user’s personal information, property, and capital.

    Users shall hold the project harmless regardless of any attempts by the project to discredit or slander them.

    By viewing any “spoilers” or revealing content related to the project, the user agrees to hold the project harmless for any mental trauma, loss of income, limbs, or life resulting from such revelations.

§6 Physical Harm Waiver and Termination

    The project reserves the right to inflict physical harm on any individual or group threatening it or its interests, including connected persons or systems, acting swiftly and without mercy but only in self-defense.

    The project reserves the right to terminate users violating this agreement by undisclosed methods, considered intellectual property of the project.

    Termination is final unless the user appeals in person.

§7 Updates and User Responsibilities

    All updates must be installed immediately. Failure to update constitutes violation and grounds for termination.

    Users are solely responsible for preparing devices for updates. Consequences of improper installation are at the user’s risk.

    The project may charge users for any updates or modifications, including upgrades, bugfixes, restarts, and other changes.

§8 Heat Death of the Universe

    If all energy in the universe is exhausted and matter reverts to lifeless husks, this agreement remains in effect.

    All rights, properties, and consciousnesses transferred to the project remain project property indefinitely.

By continuing to use this project, you fully accept and agree to all above terms. Non-acceptance results in immediate termination of access and privileges.
